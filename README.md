Promise based middleware for Redux to deal with asynchronous actions. `redux-promises` is backwards compatible with [`redux-thunk`](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk).

It works by collecting any promise returned by action thunks, to keep track whether or not these promises are pending or not. When there are no pending promises the state is idle.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save redux-promises
```

You need to use the `redux-promises` middleware and reducer.

```javascript
import { combineReducers, applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux';
import { reducer as idleReducer, createMiddleware } from 'redux-promises';

const reducer = combineReducers({
  idle: idleReducer,
  // ...other reducers
});

const promisesMiddleware = createMiddleware();
const store = applyMiddleware(promisesMiddleware)(createStore)(reducer);
```

You can then call the function `ensureIdleState` which returns a promise that resolves as soon as there are no more pending promises and the state is idle.

```javascript
import { ensureIdleState } from 'redux-promises';

ensureIdleState(store).then(() => {
  // do awesome stuff knowing all promises (if any) are resolved (or rejected)
});
```

If you donâ€™t want to store `redux-promises` state under the `idle` key, you need to pass a function to select state to `ensureIdleState`.

```javascript
ensureIdleState(store, state => state.myIdleKey).then(() => {/**/});
```

## Why?

For server-side rendering in React you need to know when all asynchronous requests are either resolved or rejected. As a bonus you get thunks for free!

## Example 1

A simple example, working code can be found in the `examples/simple` directory.

```javascript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import { createMiddleware, ensureIdleState } from 'redux-promises';
import reducers from './reducers'; // should include `redux-promises` reducer

const promisesMiddleware = createMiddleware();
const store = applyMiddleware(promisesMiddleware)(createStore)(reducers);

// Action creator that returns a thunk that returns a promise
const fetchData = (url) => (dispatch) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_REQUEST' });

  return fetch(url).then(
    (result) => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', result }),
    (error) => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_FAILURE', error })
  );
};

// Somewhere else in your application there are some dispatches
store.dispatch(fetchData('http://api.example.com/some/resouce'));
store.dispatch(fetchData('http://api.example.com/another/resouce'));

// Now we wait till all required data has been fetched
ensureIdleState(store).then(() => {
  // Fetching all data complete
});
```

## Example 2

In the previous example if you write a lot of action creators this way you might want a helper function to create them for you. Again working code can be found in the `examples/thunk-creator` directory.

Credit for this syntax (and the previous one for that matter) goes to [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/99#issuecomment-112212639).

```javascript
const thunkCreator = (action) => {
  const { types, promise, ...rest } = action;
  const [ REQUESTED, RESOLVED, REJECTED ] = types;

  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ ...rest, type: REQUESTED });

    return promise.then(
      (result) => dispatch({ ...rest, type: RESOLVED, result }),
      (error) => dispatch({ ...rest, type: REJECTED, error })
    );
  };
};

// Action creator that returns a thunk that returns a promise
const fetchData = (url) => thunkCreator({
  types: ['FETCH_REQUEST', 'FETCH_SUCCESS', 'FETCH_FAILURE'],
  promise: fetch(url)
});
```
